# Battleship
Short Summary:
    This is an interactive and dynamic version of the baord game Battleship made using Python. The game will have 2 levels of increasing difficulty and each will have a slightly modified method of playing. 
    Level 1 involves only one board. The user must guess the coordinate of the battleship that the computer has randomly generated. Hints will be given to the user. 
    Level 2 involves 2 boards. It is thus, similar to the actual board game.  Here, the user is now playing against the computer instead of dealing with a limited number of lives.
